\section{Introduction}
In this analysis, we present our findings on a multitude of soil sensors, all of which have the potential to be useful to the MINTS soil research program. Given the variations among these devices (in price, reliability, build quality, technical popularity, etc.), sensors belonging to a unique category will be collectively scrutinized in accordance with several criteria which we determined to be pertinent to MINTS soil research:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reliability and cost effectiveness
    \item Outputs
    \item Quality %could be removed on the basis of the lack of info available to us
    \item Popularity within the scientific community (based on scholarly articles and papers)
\end{enumerate}
